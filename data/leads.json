    "title": "Jack Dorsey Gave $10M to Nostr Dev Devoted to Fascist 'Guru' - Business Insider",
    "description": "The founder is a Brazilian man who appears to be a big fan of a fascist conspiracy theorist. In his quest to support alternative social-media platforms, Twitter&#x27;s cofounder Jack Dorsey unwittingly funded a developer who&#x27;s a follower of a Brazilian fascist, according to archived webpages and business records. The funding, which supported the development of the decentralized social-media protocol Nostr, comes as Silicon Valley&#x27;s rightward political drift has become more apparent and as some in tech&#x27;s elite push back against what they perceive as overreach in censorship and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",

By early 2020, @Fiatjaf had got the attention of his current part-time employer, Zebedee, a Hoboken, New Jersey, video game startup building software that lets game developers give players bitcoin rewards. After much pleading on behalf of Zebedee co-founder Andre Neves, 31, he convinced @Fiatjaf to take a full-time remote job, putting him in charge of an internal project called NBD.WTF, now housing five open-source projects related to bitcoin, and Nostr.",
